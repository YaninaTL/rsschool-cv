## About Me
Currently a multilingual English/Russian tutor who is going to change lives drastically
being a great webdev. 
I have been surrounded by languages for many years. My path of
learning, practising and teaching has been a long one. However,
the thirst for new knowledge has opened up to me the fascinating
world of programming languages. My goal is to become a
professional in Front-end development, as well as I am eager to
teach newcomers and share my experience. Therefore, I look forward
to joining open source projects, working in a team and finding a
mentor.
